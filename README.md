STEM 103 Intro to Python  


## Author  
My name is Kaleb Palilla. I am learning Python in this intro course.  

##  Program Using For Loop  
I will be making a program utilizing for loops and using knowledge I have gained up until now.  
This program will be using already provided data sets regarding NASA Missions that include name, year, and success/fail status.  
I will show the total number of missions, number of successful missions, show the success rate (in a percentage),  
and show the names of the missions launched before the year 2000. The data shown to user must match what was provided as well.  
This assignment will be using "len" a lot in order to obtain the data needed for desired output.
